# FINAI – Agentic AI Loan Sales Assistant (Tata Capital | EY Techathon)

FINAI is an Agentic AI–powered web chatbot that simulates an end-to-end personal loan sales journey for a large NBFC like Tata Capital.  
It mimics a human loan sales executive by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents to guide customers from first interaction to sanction letter generation.

This project is built as part of **EY Techathon – Challenge II (BFSI)**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Personal loan sales through digital channels suffer from low conversion rates, fragmented verification steps, and delayed approvals.  
NBFCs require a conversational, human-like digital assistant that can engage customers, verify eligibility, evaluate credit risk, and generate sanction letters within a single seamless journey.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

FINAI introduces an **Agentic AI architecture** where a **Master Agent** coordinates multiple **Worker Agents** to complete the entire loan sales lifecycle inside a chat interface.

The solution:
- Engages customers conversationally
- Captures intent dynamically
- Performs eligibility checks instantly
- Handles KYC, underwriting, and sanction generation automatically

  Validates PAN and logs DPDP consent using mock CRM data
- **Underwriting Agent**  
  Fetches mock CIBIL score, applies eligibility rules, and decides approval or rejection
- **Sanction Letter Generator**  
  Generates a professional PDF sanction letter upon successful approval
